// ApprovalChannel — the SEAM between "an engine wants to run a tool" and "someone
// decides yes/no". The engine (claude SDK canUseTool, or codex) produces a neutral
// ApprovalRequest and awaits an ApprovalDecision; HOW that decision is obtained is a
// swappable channel: a webview button today, a phone push tomorrow, an auto-policy
// in CI. The engine never knows which — it just calls channel.request().
//
// This is deliberately CLI/SDK-neutral (no claude/codex types leak in) so the same
// request can be rendered on any surface and answered from anywhere.

// A multiple-choice question (claude's AskUserQuestion): one or more questions, each with
// options the user picks from. NOT a yes/no permission — the user's CHOICE becomes the

// may widen its permission rules); "deny" blocks with an optional reason. updatedInput
// lets an approver tweak args before the tool runs (claude supports this). For a
// `question` request, `answers` maps each question text → the chosen option label(s)
// (joined with ", " when multiSelect); the engine turns that into the tool result.
